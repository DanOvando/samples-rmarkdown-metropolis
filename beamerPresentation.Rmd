## Metropolis

- https://github.com/matze/mtheme -- Official GitHub Repo of
  Metropolis (formerly mtheme); older version in TeXLive
- https://github.com/eddelbuettel/pkg-latex-metropolis -- My local GitHub Repo for an Ubuntu package of Metropolis (formerly mtheme)
- https://github.com/eddelbuettel/pkg-fonts-fira -- My local GitHub Repo for an Ubuntu package] for the Fira font

## Ubuntu and Launchpad

- The packages which can be built (ie not Fira as it needs external fonts
  which we cannot download during build) are
  in this repo: https://launchpad.net/~edd/+archive/ubuntu/misc/+packages
- If you're not on Ubuntu, it is probably more work to get
    - Metropolis into your \LaTeX environment
    - the Fira font into your \LaTeX environment
- I *did* try without (on plain Ubuntu 16.04) and it _builds_ but looks less
crisp
- So for the time being you probably want these fresh from source, or via my
helpers. YMMV.

## Local Adaption

- mtheme and metropolis changed a bit since I first used
- I started with a local modification I called m2; the package is still in
the launchpad repo
- I generally include a file `header.tex` from the YAML for color, font,
  ... tweaking at the \LaTeX level, but as these are presentation-specific I
  didn't include any changes here.
